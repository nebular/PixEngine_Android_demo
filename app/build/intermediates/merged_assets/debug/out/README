PLACE YOUR ASSETS HERE

This folder will be copied recursively to the application internal storage on
every application start.

additionally, olc::PixelEngine::ROOTPATH contain this path, you might need it.

The engine methods that deal with files (olc::Sprite::load...) are aware of that,
so it will "just work" if you do Sprite.load("images/lollipop.png") and place the
images/ folder here, etc.
