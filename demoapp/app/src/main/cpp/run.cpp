// trick to make this code executed as Android loads the library, before anything
// else. We inject in the static field ROOTINSTANCE of the olcPixelEngine shared library
// our instantiated PixelGameEngine class.

// Thanks to this dirty trick, the JNI launcher, and the OLC  libs,
// are independent shared libraries that have their own CMAKE, so it is really
// easy to link them into new projects, package, distribute, etc ... vs. manually
// having to craft a bif CMAKE everytime.
